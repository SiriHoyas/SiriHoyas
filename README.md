## About me 🙋🏻‍♀️

For the past ten years I worked in consumer electronic retail. I worked my way up from part-time employee, to Department Manager of Operations. My passion has always been tech, and when the pandemic hit I started taking tutorials on programming. I decided to pursue it as a career, and enrolled at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. 

In my studies I have had courses in UX Design, IxD and general design principles, and I really enjoyed working with design. This is a skill I want to develop further, and in addition to working as a developer, I would like to also work with design.

Come fall 2023, I will be working as a developer for Capgemini
