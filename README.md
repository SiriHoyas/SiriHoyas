## About me 🙋🏻‍♀️
For the past ten years i worked in consumer electronic retail. I worked my way up from part-time employee, to Department Manager of Operations. My passion has always been tech, and when the pandemic hit i started taking tutorials on programming. I decided to pursue it as a career, and enrolled at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. I am currently finishing my first year and is just one year more awat from becoming a front end developer. 

In my studies i had courses in UX Design, IxD and general design principles, and i really enjoyed it. This is a skill i want to develop further, and in addition to working as a developer, I would like to also work with design.
